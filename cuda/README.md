## cuBLAS
The NVIDIA cuBLAS library is a fast GPU-accelerated implementation of the standard basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS). Using cuBLAS APIs, you can speed up your applications by deploying compute-intensive operations to a single GPU or scale up and distribute work across multi-GPU configurations efficiently.

## cuDNN
cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks, provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers.

## Thrust
Thrust is a powerful library of parallel algorithms and data structures. Thrust provides a flexible, high-level interface for GPU programming that greatly enhances developer productivity. Using Thrust, C++ developers can write just a few lines of code to perform GPU-accelerated sort, scan, transform, and reduction operations orders of magnitude faster than the latest multi-core CPUs.

## NCCL
NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines for GPUs, implementing all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, and reduce-scatter. It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on platforms using PCIe, NVLink, NVswitch, as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP sockets. NCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in a single node or across multiple nodes, and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.
